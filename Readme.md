Please join a group of 4 engineers and together choose an idea from the following to start designing and implementing the backend for it.

- start by designing the schema used for your chosen application    

- then divide the CRUD backend tasks among yourselves

- start working on these tasks each on their own computer

- a github repo will be assigned to you and you should all push your changes into this project
